# North South University Management System

## Overview
This project is a university management system designed to efficiently manage student, faculty, and course records. It uses modern C++ features and data structures to ensure high performance and scalability.

## Key Features
- **Student Management:** Handles the addition, enrollment, and retrieval of student records.
- **Faculty Management:** Manages faculty member records, including course assignments.
- **Course Management:** Manages course records, including the list of enrolled students and assigned faculty members.

## Explanation of Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Hash Tables (`std::unordered_map`):** Efficient for storing and retrieving records.
- **Sets (`std::unordered_set`):** Manages course enrollments and faculty assignments.
- **Smart Pointers (`std::shared_ptr`):** Ensures effective memory management.
- **Concurrency (`std::shared_mutex`):** Supports concurrent operations for multi-user environments.

## What Makes This Project Special
- **High Performance:** Quick access and manipulation of records.
- **Concurrency:** Supports concurrent read/write operations.
- **Memory Management:** Prevents leaks and simplifies resource management.
- **Scalability:** Handles large datasets and complex relationships.
- **Real-world Application:** Improves efficiency and accuracy in managing university records.
